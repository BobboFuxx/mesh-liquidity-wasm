## Synopsis ICS101

This document specifies states, msgs and testcases for ics101 cosmwasm integration demo.
For the detailed specification of ics101, please check [ics101 ibc spec document]().

### Motivation

Ics101 go version is already developed and currently in the test and review phase. This cosmwasm integration is developed to interact between a chain that has integrated go version ics101 and a chain that doesn't have go version integration.
It can be also used between the chains without ics101 integration, using this cosmwasm contract on each chain.
